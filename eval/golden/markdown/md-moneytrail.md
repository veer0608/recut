[![ci](https://github.com/veer0608/moneytrail/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/veer0608/moneytrail/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Turn bank statements into a ledger that **provably adds up**, then ask it the
questions no banking app will answer.

> *Did that Myntra refund from March ever actually arrive?*
> *What am I paying for every month that I stopped using?*
> *Was I charged twice for anything this year?*

Local-first: statements are parsed on your machine and never leave it.

---

## The idea

Every personal-finance tool starts by categorising transactions. That is the
wrong first step. If the parse dropped a row (a wrapped narration, a page
break, a misread decimal) then every category total, every "you spent 23% more
on food" insight, and every answer built on top of it is quietly wrong, and
nothing in the product will ever tell you.

So moneytrail's first component is not a categoriser. It is a **reconciliation
gate**, and it is checked against arithmetic the bank already published:

| check | what it proves |
|---|---|
| `chain` | walking the running-balance column, every row moves the balance by exactly its own amount; this localises a fault to a line number |
| `totals` | `opening + credits − debits == closing`; catches faults the chain cannot see, including rows lost off the end |

This is free ground truth. No labelling, no judgement, no model. A statement
either reconciles to the paisa or it does not, and if it does not, the tool says
which row and by how much.

**Money is an integer count of paise, everywhere.** `0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3` in
binary. A float pipeline cannot promise "to the paisa", so there are no floats
in this codebase, amounts are only rendered as rupees at the edge.

## It works

A clean statement:

```
tests/fixtures/hdfc_april_2025.csv
  bank            HDFC
  account         XXXXXXXX4471
  period          2025-04-01 -> 2025-04-25
  transactions    7 (7 carry a running balance)
  opening             ₹45,231.60  (explicit)
  credits     +       ₹87,499.00
  debits      -       ₹36,560.00
  computed            ₹96,170.60
  closing             ₹96,170.60  (explicit)
  RECONCILED to the paisa
```

The same statement with one row lost during parsing:

```
tests/fixtures/hdfc_april_2025_dropped_row.csv
  ...
  computed            ₹96,819.60
  closing             ₹96,170.60  (explicit)
  FAILED -- 2 discrepancy(ies):
    [chain] row 10: expected ₹1,27,320.60, statement says ₹1,26,671.60 (off by -₹649.00)
            -- UPI-MYNTRADESIGNS-MYNTRA@AXISBANK-UTIB0000441-509912834-ORDER
    [totals] statement total: expected ₹96,819.60, statement says ₹96,170.60 (off by -₹649.00)
```

₹649.00 is exactly the missing Netflix charge, and row 10 is the line right
after the gap. A silent data-loss bug becomes a line number.

### Reading a failure

The walk resyncs to the bank's printed balance after each break, so faults stay
local instead of cascading. That gives two distinguishable signatures:

- **one** chain fault → a row is **missing** before that line
- **two adjacent** faults with **equal and opposite** deltas → that row's
  **balance** was misread; the amounts around it are fine

## Usage

```bash
python -m moneytrail check path/to/statement.pdf
python -m moneytrail check path/to/statement.csv
python -m moneytrail check path/to/a/folder
python -m moneytrail check statements/ --certificate certificate.pdf

python -m moneytrail export statements/ --out ledger.xlsx

python -m moneytrail merchants statements/
python -m moneytrail review statements/
python -m moneytrail spend statements/
```

Encrypted PDFs prompt for a password without echoing it, so it stays out of
your shell history; the password is used to open the file and then dropped.
`--password` is there for scripts, and `--no-prompt` reports locked files and
carries on, for CI.

Exit code is non-zero if anything fails to reconcile.

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Status

**Everything below is shipped.** 499 tests, CI green on 3.11 and 3.12.

- **CSV / TSV / delimited-text** net-banking exports.
- **PDF**, including the password-protected ones banks email you. Ruled tables
  are recovered from their borders; borderless ones (which is most real
  statements) have their columns recovered from where the words sit under the
  header, wrapped narrations and all. Scanned PDFs are rejected rather than
  guessed at, and so is a text layer carrying no column information: see
  [Reading a PDF that draws no table](#reading-a-pdf-that-draws-no-table).
- **Spreadsheets**, including the very common case of an OOXML workbook shipped
  under an `.xls` name. Magic bytes decide the format, never the extension.
- **Credit-card statements**, detected from content rather than filename.
- The reconciliation gate and the CLI.

### Cards reconcile differently

A card statement has no running balance, so there is no chain to walk. What it
does publish is a summary box, and that box is the ground truth:

| check | what it proves |
|---|---|
| `summary` | `previous − payments + purchases + fees == total due`: the issuer's own arithmetic |
| `rows-debit` / `rows-credit` | the transaction rows this parse recovered sum to the totals the box states: the only check that says the ledger is *complete* |

A statement that prints no totals is reported `UNVERIFIED` rather than passing
quietly. And the sign convention inverts: on a card, `Cr` is money coming off
what you owe, the opposite of a bank statement's credit column, reading the
bank convention there would flip the entire ledger.

Card transactions reuse the same `Transaction` type, so the merchant rollup
works on them unchanged. That matters, because the card statement is where the
merchant spend actually is.

All three formats go through one code path: a parser's only job is to recover a
grid, and `parsers/table.py` turns rows into a statement. The test suite parses
the same statement as CSV, as PDF and as a workbook, and asserts all three
ledgers are identical.

**Verified against a real bank export:** 225 transactions across three months of
an HDFC statement reconcile to the paisa, and against the closing balance the
bank prints in its own summary block, not merely against the rows' internal
consistency. Four defects surfaced in that first contact with real data, none
of which the synthetic fixtures could have found: divider rows drawn in
asterisks, amounts masked with `******`, a two-row summary block at the foot,
and an IFSC code being mistaken for a reference number. Each is now a test.

**Phase 2 is shipped.** `moneytrail merchants` rolls a ledger up by counterparty
and category.

- narrations are taken apart structurally: find the VPA, and the counterparty
  is the segment beside it, which works across banks without per-bank patterns
- welded merchant names are un-welded (`SWIGGYINSTAMART` → Swiggy Instamart) by
  minimum-cost segmentation over a vocabulary, all-or-nothing so a run that
  cannot be fully covered is left intact
- names resolve through a lexicon, and every match records *how* it was reached
  (`lexicon` / `vpa` / `prefix` / `segmented` / `raw`), because a normaliser
  that hides its confidence cannot be debugged

### What measuring it changed

Merchant coverage on the real statement came out at **18%**, and chasing that
number would have been the wrong response. Classifying the *counterparty* first
showed why it was low:

| counterparty | share of a real 225-transaction statement |
|---|---|
| person-to-person transfer | 41% |
| credit-card bill repayment | 18% |
| bank charges and interest | 5% |
| recognised merchant | 4% |
| still unclassified | 32% |

**This is not a merchant-heavy ledger.** A bigger brand lexicon would have moved
almost nothing; the value is in transfers and card bills, which is where phases
3 and 5 now point. Reporting one "resolved" percentage would have hidden that
entirely, so the tool reports the classification breakdown alongside it: a
transfer to a friend is understood, not an unresolved merchant.

The same pass found the largest single outflow filed under the wrong category:
CRED is a card-bill platform, not a fee.

### Where the money actually went

`moneytrail spend` treats a card bill payment as what it is: one event recorded
twice, as a debit leaving the bank and as a credit reducing what the card says
you owe. Counting both double-counts the money.

```
  bank outflow                  ₹45,900.00
  repayments matched    -       ₹12,450.00   (1 linked to a card statement)
  card charges          +        ₹8,320.50
  ----------------------------------------
  actually spent                ₹41,770.50
```

Repayments are matched to card-side payments on an exact amount and a date
window. **A repayment with no card statement behind it stays counted**, because
the purchases it settled are not in front of us, removing it would understate
spending, and understating is the more dangerous error. The report names those
repayments rather than burying the assumption. Card payments with no matching
bank debit are reported too: they were settled from an account you did not
supply.

### The questions

`moneytrail review` reports three things, and is careful about which:

```
  recurring charges
    Housing Rent Shobha Apartme… monthly    ₹28,000.00  ₹3,40,666.67 /yr  last 2025-05-12  active
    Netflix                      monthly       ₹649.00      ₹7,896.17 /yr  last 2025-05-05  active
    Spotify                      monthly       ₹119.00      ₹1,447.83 /yr  last 2025-03-07  stopped

  possible duplicate charges
    2025-03-18  Swiggy      ₹450.00 x2  none refunded, ₹450.00 still out
    2025-02-10  Amazon    ₹1,299.00 x2  1 refunded, ₹0.00 still out

  refunds that arrived
    2025-02-20  Amazon    ₹1,299.00  10 days after the 2025-02-10 charge
    2025-04-27  Myntra    ₹2,499.00  12 days after the 2025-04-15 charge
```

- **Cadence is measured, not assumed.** Three charges at irregular gaps are a
  habit, not a subscription, and are not reported as one. Amounts that swing
  wildly disqualify a run too. Monthly rent qualifies: a cadence detector that
  only found streaming services would be missing the expensive half.
- **Duplicates are candidates, not verdicts.** Buying the same coffee twice
  looks identical to being charged twice, so each one is reported with its span
  and how much is still outstanding after any refund, and you judge.
- **Refunds that never arrived cannot be found.** Nothing in a statement records
  that you asked for one. The report says so rather than implying the absence of
  a finding means nothing is owed to you.

### More than one account

Move ₹25,000 between your own accounts and a naive merge records ₹25,000 spent
and ₹25,000 earned. Neither happened. `spend` matches debits on one account to
credits on another and removes them from both sides:

```
  bank outflow                  ₹53,600.00
  transfers to yourself -       ₹25,000.00   (1 moved between your own accounts)
  actually spent                ₹28,600.00

  bank inflow                 ₹1,05,000.00
  less those transfers  -       ₹25,000.00
  actually received             ₹80,000.00
```

Matching only ever pairs *across* accounts. A debit and credit on the same
statement is a refund, not a transfer. And because paying a friend a round sum
on the day someone pays you the same amount would look identical, both
narrations are printed so you can see exactly what was matched to what.

Card repayments and inter-account transfers turned out to be the same
operation, namely finding the credit on another document that this debit
produced, so they share one matcher rather than two that can drift apart.

### Reading a PDF that draws no table

Most converters recover a table from its **ruling** (the lines a document
draws around its cells) because that is the easy case and pdfplumber does it
for free. Most real bank statements draw no ruling at all. Three third-party
sample PDFs, two ICICI and one HDFC from separate projects, report **zero
lines, zero rects and zero edges** between them, and `extract_table()` returns
`None` on all three. Before `words.py`, every PDF this project had parsed
successfully was one it generated itself, in the single easiest layout there
is, and the test suite had been agreeing with itself.

`words.py` recovers the columns from where the words sit. The header names them
at known positions, so: cluster words into lines by vertical position, find the
line that names the columns, take the boundaries from the gaps between those
names, and drop every later word into the column its centre falls in. Amounts
are right-aligned under left-aligned headings, which is why a boundary sits
midway between one heading and the next rather than at either edge, and why
**direction comes from geometry**. On a real HDFC statement nothing but x
position says that `100.00` is a withdrawal and `2,000.00` is a deposit.

The hard part is that **a row is not a line**. Banks wrap a long narration over
several lines and put the date and the amounts on whichever of them they like.
Real HDFC statements print the date on the first line and the money on the
second. Real ICICI statements centre the dated line inside the narration, so
the text arrives above *and* below the figures. A row therefore starts at a
line carrying a date and absorbs the lines after it, filling any cell it does
not already have.

Two numbers worth keeping. On a real HDFC header the word spaces measure 1.8pt
and the narrowest column gap 12.7pt, so the threshold separating "space inside
a heading" from "column boundary" is derived per line rather than fixed, because
a constant that works on 10pt type does not work on 7pt, and the fixed 12.0 it
replaced sat 0.7pt away from merging two money columns and losing a whole side
of the ledger.

What this does not do: statements whose text layer carries no column
information at all. One of the three samples turned out to have been generated
by flowing words left to right, so its amounts sit under the wrong headings in
the file itself. No geometric method can read that, because the geometry is not
there, and guessing would produce a ledger that reconciles against a wrong
total, which is the one outcome this project exists to prevent. It is rejected
instead.

### Getting it back out

```bash
python -m moneytrail export statements/ --out ledger.xlsx
```

Every transaction across every statement, merged in date order, with the raw
narration kept beside the resolved merchant so a row can still be found in the
source PDF. `.csv` needs nothing installed; `.xlsx` needs the `xlsx` extra.

The point is what travels with it. Any PDF-to-spreadsheet converter can lose a
row to a wrapped narration or a page break, and what lands in the spreadsheet
still looks like a spreadsheet. The person importing it has no way to tell.
So the export carries a **reconciliation certificate**: per source file, the
arithmetic that was checked, the SHA-256 of the exact bytes it was checked
against, and whether it held.

```
  source          hdfc_april_2025.csv
  sha-256         1f733d152275ccb99eb97138e2dcd1952e0337709ae993b170eba7deb68d0a52
  bank            HDFC
  period          2025-04-01 to 2025-04-25
  transactions    7
  opening             ₹45,231.60
  credits     +       ₹87,499.00
  debits      -       ₹36,560.00
  computed            ₹96,170.60
  statement           ₹96,170.60
  checks run      chain, totals
  VERDICT         RECONCILED
```

The digest binds the certificate to bytes rather than to a filename: a filename
says which file was *meant*, a digest says which bytes were actually read, and
only the second survives being emailed around. An `.xlsx` export carries the
certificate as a second sheet, because a proof that travels separately from the thing
it proves gets detached on the first forward.

### The certificate as a page

```bash
python -m moneytrail check statements/ --certificate certificate.pdf
```

The same proof, rendered for the person who will never open a terminal and will
never look at the second tab of a workbook: one page, the verdict at the top,
the institution's own arithmetic laid out so it can be added up by hand, the
full digest, and every flagged row with its line number. Needs the
`certificate` extra (`pip install 'moneytrail[certificate]'`); `--certificate`
with any other suffix writes the plain text version and needs nothing.

It computes nothing of its own. Every figure and every verdict on the page comes
from the same `certify()` the terminal output uses, so there is no second
opinion to drift.

Where a system font carrying ₹ can be found it is embedded and *verified* to
have the glyph before use -- reportlab's built-in Helvetica has no U+20B9 at all
and draws a box. Failing that the page says `INR 1,23,456.78`, because a missing
currency mark on an Indian statement is not a cosmetic problem.

A statement that fails to reconcile is **still exported**. Withholding the data
only sends you back to a converter that cannot tell you anything is wrong. It
is written stamped instead: every row carries `reconciled = NO`, the certificate
leads with the failure, and the exit code is 1.

```
NOT RECONCILED -- 1 statement(s) did not add up:
  hdfc_april_2025_dropped_row.csv
    row 10: expected ₹1,27,320.60, statement says ₹1,26,671.60 (off by -₹649.00)
    statement total: expected ₹96,819.60, statement says ₹96,170.60 (off by -₹649.00)
```

Amounts are written as exact decimals, never floats: summing the column is the
first thing anyone receiving this will do, and it has to match the certificate
printed beside it. CSV is written with a BOM so Excel on Windows opens it as
UTF-8 rather than turning every rupee sign into mojibake.

### The hosted version

```bash
pip install -e ".[web]"
python -m moneytrail.api        # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Drop statements on the page, get the trust strip, the workbook and the
certificate as a one-page PDF back. All three arrive in the same response and
the browser saves them from memory: there is no download endpoint, because a
download endpoint would need the file to still exist after the request that
made it, and nothing here does. It exists
because the people who most need the certificate, accountants reconciling a
dozen client statements a month, will not `pip install` anything, and a promise
nobody can reach is worth less than a weaker one they can.

So this is the one place the local-first rule bends, and the README would rather
be exact than reassuring. The CLI's promise is absolute: nothing leaves the
machine. A server cannot say that. What it says instead is narrower and true:
the uploaded bytes live inside a single request, in a temporary directory removed
before the reply is written; there is no database, nothing is logged but the
method and path, and no second request exists that could see them. The parsers
take paths rather than bytes, so the upload really is written to disk for the
seconds it takes to read it, and the page says so rather than claiming otherwise.
There is a test asserting every scratch directory is gone by the time the
response is built.

The workbook rides home inside the same JSON response and is assembled into a
file by your browser. That is what keeps the server stateless: no second request
to serve means nothing worth keeping between them.

`web.py` holds the reasoning and imports no framework; `api.py` is the only file
that touches FastAPI. The page is a single HTML file with no build step, no CDN
and no analytics, the same test the offline report has, asserting the served
page contains no `http://`, no `src=` and no `@import`.

### The landing page

The tool sits at the top of it, not behind a call to action. For this product
the demo *is* the pitch, a click that shows a missing row being caught argues
better than any paragraph underneath it, and every step between a visitor and
that moment costs some of them.

`Try a broken one` loads a statement with one ₹649 row removed, whose own
closing balance still agrees with its own last row, and reconciles it in front
of you. It has to be the site's own file: nobody uploads a bank statement to
prove a point to a page they have not decided to trust yet. There is a test
asserting the sample actually fails, so the demo can never quietly become a
prop that passes.

Price, shop link and repository link are all served by `/api/pricing` rather
than written into the markup. A price in HTML drifts from the checkout it links
to, and the served page is asserted to contain **no absolute URL at all**,
which is what keeps "this page loads nothing from anywhere else" checkable by
reading it instead of trusting it.

### Paying for it

The hosted service charges for volume: one statement at a time free, batches
with a licence key. The certificate is never behind the paywall: it is the
entire argument for the product, and a free tier without it would be one more
silent converter with nothing to come back for. What a firm pays to stop doing
is reconciling a dozen clients one file at a time.

Licence keys rather than accounts, and that is a design constraint rather than
a shortcut. Accounts need a database, a session, a password reset and somewhere
to keep an email address, and the sentence this product rests on is that there
is no database and nothing is kept between requests. A paid tier built on
storage would sell the reason anyone trusts it in order to charge for it. A key
is a bearer token for batch conversion, it lives in your browser, and there is
no account for it to unlock.

```bash
MONEYTRAIL_GUMROAD_PRODUCT_ID   # set it to turn the gate on
MONEYTRAIL_BUY_URL              # where the page sends someone who needs a key
```

**With no product id set, everything is unlocked.** The CLI, a local run and
anyone self-hosting this repo never meet a paywall. The gate exists on the
hosted instance and nowhere else.

Two details worth keeping, both of which cost money when they are wrong. Gumroad
answers `success: true` for a purchase that was later refunded, so the refund,
dispute, chargeback and subscription fields are checked separately; reading
success as "has paid" would leave anyone who took their money back with
permanent access. And a payment processor's outage must not lock out someone who
paid, so a key that verified recently keeps working from cache for a day, while
a key never seen before is told to *try again*, a different sentence from
*that key is not valid*, and one that has to stay different.

### The trust strip

```bash
python -m moneytrail report statements/ --open
```

Writes one self-contained HTML file. Deliberately a file, not a server: no
ports, no build step, and no network of any kind. There is a test asserting the
page contains no `http`, no `<script>`, no `src=` and no `@import`, so the "your
data never leaves the machine" claim is checkable by reading the output.

The layout is an argument about what matters:

1. **Was every statement read correctly?** One tile per statement, green if it
   reconciled to the paisa, amber if it reconciled only against figures taken
   from its own rows, red with the row locator and the exact delta if it failed.
   *No other finance tool tells you this*, and every number below it is
   worthless if the answer is no.
2. **Open loops**: duplicate charges never refunded, card bills paid with no
   card statement covering them, card payments no supplied account explains.
3. **Recurring**: active and stopped, with the annual cost.
4. **Where it went**: the category breakdown, last and smallest, because it is
   the part every other app already has.

Generated reports contain everything the statements do, so `*.html` is
gitignored and the command says so each time it runs.

### Asking it things

```bash
python -m moneytrail ask "how much did I spend on rent in March" statements/
```

```
  ₹28,000.00 spent on rent in March 2025, across 1 transaction

  filters   direction=debit, category=rent, period=March 2025
  evidence  1 row
    2025-03-12     ₹28,000.00  Housing Rent Shobha A… ACH D- HOUSING RENT SHOBHA APARTMENTS
```

**No model runs here, and that is the design rather than a shortcut.** A
language model asked to read a ledger and report a total can produce a
confident, plausible, wrong number, and nothing in the output would show it.
Questions are parsed into a structured query; the arithmetic is done by code;
every answer arrives carrying the rows it came from.

That also leaves the right seam for a model: let it translate English into one
of these queries, and keep the engine computing the number. The model picks
what to ask; it never gets to decide what the answer is. That seam is now
built, and [measured](#letting-a-model-ask).

Three consequences worth pointing at:

- **It refuses rather than answering a different question.** Ask about a
  merchant these statements have never seen and it says so. An earlier version
  silently dropped the unknown name and returned the total for *everything* that
  month, the exact failure this project exists to prevent, caught by a test.
- **Relative dates resolve against the ledger, not against today.** A statement
  ending in May answers "last month" as April forever, so the same question
  cannot drift into a different answer over time.
- **What it cannot do, it says.** Ask whether a refund arrived and never got
  one, and the answer notes that a refund you were owed but never issued leaves
  no trace in a statement.

### Letting a model ask

The regex parser understands the questions it was built for and nothing else.
A model understands the phrasing but cannot be trusted with the arithmetic. So
the model is given one job, turning English into a query, and the engine keeps
the other:

```bash
python -m moneytrail ask --model llama-3.3-70b-versatile "what did I spend on food in the first half of the year" statements/
```

It is handed the query schema and *this ledger's own merchant and category
names*, and returns JSON. That JSON is validated into the same `Query` the
regex parser produces and executed by the same `run()`. A model that invents a
merchant is refused by the same guard that refuses an unknown name typed by a
person, because the engine would answer an invented merchant with a confident
zero, and a confident zero reads exactly like *you spent nothing there*.

The output names which parser worked the question out. With no key configured,
`--model` falls back to the built-in parser and says so; without the flag,
nothing reaches for a network even when a key is present.

No dependency and nothing to install: `moneytrail/llm.py` speaks HTTP over the
standard library, and Groq, OpenAI, Gemini, Together, OpenRouter and a local
Ollama all take the same request shape, so swapping provider is one
environment variable.

### The scorecard

`evals/questions.yaml` holds 71 questions, each paired with **the query it
should become**, never with a number. Gold answers are produced by running
the gold query through the engine, which is what made a golden set this size
free to label and is why it cannot go stale: change the engine and the gold
changes with it.

```bash
python -m evals.runner --models deterministic,llama-3.3-70b-versatile
```

Two accuracies, because they answer different questions. **Query accuracy**
asks whether the parser requested the same measurement, field by field.
**Answer accuracy** only asks whether the number matched, which a wrong query
can manage by luck. Three question sets, because two would have been
dishonest:

| set | n | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| deterministic-covered | 39 | what the regex parser was built for. CI holds it at 100% here |
| model-only | 25 | one query expresses these; no regex parses them |
| beyond-schema | 7 | no single query expresses these at all; refusing is the right answer |

The only lever on model quality here is the prompt, and a prompt tuned by
reading the questions it failed, then scored on those same questions, reports
a number fitted to its own answer key. So **40% of the set is held back**, and
which 40% is decided by a hash of the question text rather than by anything
editable, whoever tunes the prompt does not get to choose what they are
marked on. The table below is the **held-out half**, 29 questions the prompt
was never shown.

<!-- /SCORECARD -->

**A model earns its place on the half the regex cannot reach.** The parser
scores 0% on model-only by construction; the models reach 80–90%.

**And size is not what buys it.** Three models tie at exactly 89.7% query and
93.1% answer accuracy, across a **4.4× spread in price**:

| model | $/question | vs cheapest |
|---|---|---|
| `openai/gpt-oss-20b` | $0.000151 | 1.0× |
| `openai/gpt-oss-120b` | $0.000291 | 1.9× |
| `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | $0.000657 | 4.4× |

They get there differently. `llama-3.3-70b` is the best on the model-only half
(90% query, 100% answer) and pays for it by slipping to 93.8% on the questions
the regex parser handles perfectly, while the two `gpt-oss` models hold 100%
there. On the whole held-out set that nets out identical. `gpt-oss-20b` is the
one to run: same accuracy, a quarter of the price of the 70B, and the fastest
of the three at the p50.

Below that, `llama-3.1-8b-instant` at a third of the price is genuinely worse
(69% query), so the cheap end does have a floor. The finding is that the
ceiling arrives early, not that size never matters.

**And the prompt tuning did not survive contact with the held-out half.**
Iterating against dev failures moved the test half from 27/29 to 26/29 on
query accuracy. One question was fixed, two broke, and the cause is traceable
rather than statistical: a rule reading *"'how many'/'how often' are count,
everything else is total"*, written to fix a dev question about BigBasket,
swallowed *"did money come back from Myntra?"*, which is a refund question,
contradicting a rule higher up the same prompt. At n=29 one question is inside
the noise, but the mechanism is not: it is what tuning against a visible set
looks like from the inside, and without the split it would have been published
as an improvement.

The third set exists because two of the questions this phase was designed
around: *"compare March and April"*, *"which subscription went up in price"*.
turn out not to be expressible in the query schema at all. Scoring them against
an invented gold query would have measured nothing, so they are scored as
refusals, and what gets measured is whether a parser knows the limits of the
tool it is driving. The built-in parser manages 57% there: it reads
"subscription" and answers, where the honest reply is that one query cannot say
it. That is a finding, recorded rather than tuned away.

The built-in parser is a row in the table at $0, and on the half it was built
for it wins. CI gates it at 100% on those questions and never gates on a model,
which costs money and moves on someone else's schedule.

## Roadmap

| phase | what |
|---|---|
|, | Grow the parser against real statements from other banks; every format so far has broken it in a new way, and none of the breaks were in the reconciliation engine |
|, | Get it in front of one accountant. The remaining risk is contact with real files, not features |

### The number to report

Once it runs on real statements, the headline is not an accuracy score, it is:

> reconciles to the paisa on *N* of *M* statement-months across *K* banks,
> with every failure documented.

Anything that does not reconcile is a parser bug with a line number attached, so
the metric is also the bug tracker.

## Design notes

- **Derived endpoints are flagged.** If a statement states neither an opening
  nor a closing balance, both are reconstructed from the rows. The totals check
  still catches rows dropped in the middle, but it can no longer catch a fault
  in the first or last row. `is_tautological()` surfaces that rather than
  letting it pass as a clean reconcile.
- **Unparseable input raises.** An amount silently read as zero is worse than a
  crash, because it still reconciles against a wrong total.
- **Absence is not zero.** Indian statements leave the unused side of the
  debit/credit pair empty; `parse_optional_amount` returns `None`, not `0`.
- **Parsers map by header alias, not column position.** Every bank names its
  columns differently; adding a bank should be a new entry in a tuple, not a new
  branch in the parser.
- **A half-recovered PDF table is rejected.** If none of the three extraction
  passes finds a header the file is refused, because a table missing rows would
  still reconcile, against a wrong total. That includes a statement whose text
  layer carries no column information at all: the geometry is not there to be
  read, and guessing at it is the failure this rule exists to prevent.
- **Failures carry a locator.** Row number for CSV, row *and page* for PDF, so
  a discrepancy in a six-page statement is findable.
- **`.gitignore` blocks `*.pdf`, `*.csv`, `/statements/` and `/data/` by
  default**, with an explicit exception for the synthetic test fixtures. A tool
  that eats bank data must not make it easy to commit any.

## Prior art

B2B APIs (Perfios, Docsumo and similar) parse Indian statements well, but they
are built for lenders doing underwriting, not for you asking questions about
your own money. Consumer apps are cloud-hosted, closed, and usually tied to one
account. Open-source parsers mostly stop at categorisation. The gap this fills
is *local + multi-bank + answers reconciliation questions*.
